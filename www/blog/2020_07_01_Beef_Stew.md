# Cooking Experiments - Beef Stew

Welcome back to another episode of "Wow Yizhe really doesn't get bored of eating the same thing for weeks straight". I really need to get better at writing these immediately after the experiment insteaf of procrastinating.

When I first moved into this apartment, the previous tenants left behind a slow-cooker. I've always wanted to use it, and I think stew goes well with a slow cooker? So I found a beef stew slow-cooker recipe.

The difference between the first iteration till my last is insane. It started out so, so, so dry and bad and yucky... It ended with my dad, who normally hates beef, finding himself surprsingly and confusingly enjoying it.

Final results [here!](http://yizheliu.com/recipes/beef_stew.md)

Spoiler alert: the trick to delicious slow-cooker beef stew is to not use the damn slow-cooker.

## Cooking Tweaks

* Due to ingredients on hand, ratios tweaked:
* slightly less beef
* slightly more onion
* Extremely eyeballed carrots/celery (1/3 of the package I had)
* I overslept and it cooked for like 14 hours on low instead of the 8-10 the recipe called for...

## Takeaways

* Holy shit the beef is tough and tasteless and nasty.
* Everything else is pretty great though.
* The broth barely covered anything; the chunks that were in the broth seemed to taste better?
* I want to double amount of broth next time. Might be conflated with the fact that it just cooked for too long.
* Extremeley not stew-y. Barely any liquid.
* Internet clues suggest just adding more water; then adding thickener at end.

# Iteration 2

## Cooking Tweaks

* Based off a different recipe.
* This one wanted me to coat the beef chunks in flour first. Flour gets everywhere including laptop whoops.
* Stopped measuring rosemary/thyme, just put enough to coat everything.
* Final step after slow cooking: 3 teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with about 5 teaspoons of water, for 3 cups of broth.

## Takeaways

* Beef tenderness is okay.
* Beef still has absolutely no flavor and is dry as hell.
* Very slightly over salty. Can probably use 2 cups broth and 1 cup water.
* The overall flavor profile (by the spoonful) is quite nice, I swear its not stockholm syndrome. Basically, I need to figure out a way to get the flavor into the beef.

Ideas:
1. Use bigger chunks of meat and properly sear all sides to keep moisture in.
2. Add an acid, i.e. can of tomato sauce to the mixture.
3. Shorter cooking time, maybe 8 hours.
4. Marinate meat beeforehand
5. Use a different / fattier cut of meat

# Iteration 3

![Iteration 3, finished](http://yizheliu.com/beef_stew_iteration_3_finished.jpg =300x)

## Cooking Tweaks

* New recipe! Ish. Kind of.
* I sort of combined everything I had read about online on ways to make stew meet more tender and hodge-podged them together.
* Started with marinating beef with half a minced garlic, half a bottle of red wine. Will sit in fridge for maybe 5 hours.
* Tossed in a can of tomato sauce
* Used a stove instead for 2.5 hours.

## Takeaways

* Oh my goodness this tastes amazing now. The beef is so much more tender than beefore and actually flavorful.
* Slightly tough, can probably be 2 hours instead of 2.5
* After eating it for an entire day: "WAIT A SECOND I FORGOT TO PUT POTATOS IN, HOW DID I FORGET AND ALSO NOT NOTICE UNTIL 3 MEALS IN"

# Iteration 4

## Cooking tweaks

Different ingredients since I'm at parent's home for Dad's birthday and cooking here.

* One large red onion
* Different cut of meat: beef chuck short rib. Noticeably more fat (i.e. more than zero) in the cuts
* No celery this time cause Dad doesn't like it
* 2 cups 33% less sodium chicken stock

## Takeaways

* Well my dad normally hates beef... he enjoyed this one. Biased much?
* It felt like a can of tomato sauce was too much
