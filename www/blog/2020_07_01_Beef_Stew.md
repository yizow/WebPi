# Iteration 1

## Cooking Tweaks

Due to ingredients on hand, ratios tweaked:
slightly less beef
slightly more onion
Extremely eyeballed carrots/celery (1/3 of the package I had)
I overslept and it cooked for like 14 hours on low...

## Takeaways

Holy shit the beef is tough and tasteless and nasty.
Everything else is pretty great though.
The broth barely covered anything; the chunks that were in the broth seemed to taste better?

Double amount of broth next time. Might be conflated with the fact that it just cooked for too long.
Extremeley not stew-y. Barely any liquid.
Internet clues suggest just adding more water; then adding thickener at end.
