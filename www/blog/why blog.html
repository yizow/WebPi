# Why Blog

* Writing clearly requires thinking clearly
* Training how to think
  * if you cant explain it, you dont understand it
  * i'd like to understand myself
* Training how to write
  * say less with more
* sense of pride and accomplishment
  * link reddit comment
* Safe space to discover my own flavor of humor
* Interesting to see how my thoughts change / stay the same over time
* I find myself having the same conversations with different people
  * doesnt seem too weird. I like talking about what I currently care / think about
  * What i care doesn't change even if my conversational partner does
  * Nice place to "rough draft" conversations.
* I think my thoughts are interesting.
  * Maybe other people will too
* This is almost a diary
* So why make it public?
  * why not? There shouldn't be any personally identifying information
    * and the domain name... Clearly I don't care about staying anonymous
  * Feels real seeing this out there on the World Wide Web. Keeps me more motivated to keep going.
    * I want to keep going because I do ultimately think this is a useful / helpful thing to do.
