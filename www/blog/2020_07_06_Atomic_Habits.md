# Book Review - Atomic Habits *-- James Clear*

I quite enjoyed this book. James Clear has a concise, direct writing style that makes reading quite easy. 

_Atomic Habits_ is a book about the power of habits, how to create good habits, and how to break bad ones. Habits are small, tiny things. Suppose that one such habit improved some aspect of your life by just 1%. After a year of dailiy 1% increments, you'd be more than 37 times better at this metric. Similarly, a bad habit that detracts 1% from your life every day would leave you almost 50x worse off after a year.


As for shaping habits, Clear boils it down to 4 steps:

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

And similary, to _break_ a habit:

1. Make it invisible
2. Make it unattractive
3. Make it difficult
4. Make it unsatisfying


## Building a Guitar Habit
A few weeks before starting this book, I had decided to get a bit more serious about learning guitar. I would spend at least 20 minutes every day playing guitar, and try and maintain this for 30 days, and see where I was at the end of this. To help myself stay on track, I created a calendar: empty to start with, but with a red X for every day I practice. I stuck it to the front of my fridge.

Completely on accident, I had stumbled onto a lot of the ideas Clear breaks down in _Atomic Habits_

1. **Make it obvious**

    It was a giant piece of paper stuck to the front of the fridge in the living room. I saw it every time I refilled my water bottle, got a snack, cooked, chatted with roommate, just needed a break in a different room than my own.

2. **Make it attractive**

    This one was kind of a freebie for me. Making music is _inherently_ attractive to me; I love the sound of my guitar, I love the music I'm playing, and getting to maybe show off when this whole quarantine is over is just a plus on top of that.

    I made the couch in my living room couch -- i.e. the most comfortable spot in the entire apartment -- my "guitar" place. 

    Also, since my roommate's "station" is right next to the couch, guitar playing was always either preceeded or followed by fun conversations.

3. **Make it easy**

    I would find tabs or how-to song videos online beforehand. The music stand was also setup in the living room right next to the couch. Starting to play is as simple as getting up, grabbing my guitar on my way out of my room, and sitting down in the couch outside.

    I also have an alarm set for 9 pm. every day. That's guitar time: alarm goes off, I get up and go to living room. No more having to think "hmm when am I going to play guitar today"

4. **Make it satisfying**

    Being able to play a song has been oh so satisfying in and of itself. I used to only be able to play chords; I've now learned 1.5 fingerstyle songs.

    One thing I was surprised by, though, was how _damn_ satisfying it was to put a red X on the calendar every day. Even if I hadn't really made any song progress that day, seeing that streak grow and grow daily was extremely rewarding.


## Breaking a Video Game ~~Addiction~~ (I'M NOT ADDICTED MOM I CAN STOP WHENEVER I WANT)

I recently watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2Wcu6aGyz8) about willpower, and a couple other concepts that I had known about, but never really utilized. One of these is "Ego depletion": willpower is a limited resource and it gets tired like any other muscle. The other was the results of the classic Standford marshmallow experiment about delayed gratification; specifically, that while only 1/3 of the kids were able to resist the marshmallow, those that _did_, almost all utilized tactics to distract themselves, such as singing, covering their eyes, talking to themselves, spinning around the room, etc. All of this to say, there is a big difference between "I _won't_ play video games" and "I _can't_ play video games"

I've been starting every morning by unplugging the various cables on my gaming PC, and just moving it 100 feet over to the living room. It sits right next to "guitar couch".

1. **Make it invisible**

    Fun and distracting and time-sink games are no longer sitting an arm's reach away from me, right in front of my face. My PC was also on _top_ of my desk. I would literally be staring at it the whole day while trying to work. 

2. **Make it unattractive**

    Heh, I'm actually not sure about this one. Games are fun and satisfying, that hasn't changed.

3. **Make it difficult**

    While bringing the PC back into my room and plugging in 3 wires takes all of 5 minutes, it feels a lot more symbolic than that. Now I have to deliberately decide "I want to game now", instead of having access be the default.

4. **Make it unsatisfying**

    Yeah, not working here either. I think these rules are tailored more for absolutely bad things like smoking or overeating, not someting I just want to do in a ~~bit~~ lot more moderation.

At first I was worried that this would be difficult. But even on day one, just like the guy in the YouTube video, I found I very quickly just forgot about games. It was great.

That being said, it's not like I'm magically productive now. I've just found (arguably more productive?) ways to procrastinate. I usually can check off guitar before 9 pm. now...


## Guitar Learning Plans For Fun

1. I learned [Katyusha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niO9mfiF-oo).
2. I'm currently learning [Belle Ciao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3MkODlWvYA).
3. I want to learn [this tavern ballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVoUXyFPazQ) since I play a bard in my very occasional DnD sessions.
4. Toss a Coin To Your Witcher has [free tabs!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbG9MxiSzlY) They also come with actual real sheet music, so I can start graduating from pure tabs.
5. I really like [Curses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y6h-BMLDWI) from the video game [Crawl](https://store.steampowered.com/app/293780/Crawl/), and if I play it at .25x speed, I can make out individual notes. I've figured out the very first melodic phrase, and I want to eventually transcribe the whole piece to a fingerstyle arrangement.
