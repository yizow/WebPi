# Iteration 0

Failed recipe that i really didn't like.
probably my fault as i used way too much dried oregano/basil as opposed to fresh...
I learned that day they have very different {flavor unit} : volume ratios.


# Iteration 1

## Cooking Stream of Consciousness
Didn't have diced/ canned tomatos as the recipe called for. Instead I have both fresh tomatos and tomato sauce.
And I just don't have parsley.
For this first iteration I chose to use fresh tomatos: 5 of em worked out to ~25 ounces

Recipe calls for:
> Season with salt and pepper to taste

...I have next to no idea what "to taste" means. Welp, guess I'm just tossing in a random amount of salt and pepper and hoping for the best.

Lesson number 1 after adding in the tomatos: I need to dice them more.

After a bit of time of the tomatos cooking, it looks a bit too liquidy. Perhaps a 50:50 of tomatos to tomato sauce? I think internet told me that tomato sauce is thicker.

Oh no. The recipe called to simmer tomatos for 15 minutes. I have forgotten how many minutes its been...

"cup" of spinach. Naaah just toss in two giant handfuls.

Recipe calls to serve on toast. I have rice instead.

Huh. This is probably a breakfast recipe I'm having for dinner, isn't it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Takeaways

Reminds me quite a bit of traditional chinese tomato+egg+rice dish.

I want to try playing with fresh tomato: tomato sauce ratio to see if i can get a creamier/ layer on top of rice kind of thing going.

Not sure how i feel about the purgatory eggs. I find myself just eating them as part of the rest anyways. They are good though. I think it's more about the cooking time, and having it not scrambled. I cooked for a few minutes longer than the 7 minutes the recipe calls for.

Should not have attempted presentation of layering over rice. Much better to have just left it in pot, and scooped out.

Salt and pepper also seem to be good. I added in as very first step with onions and garlic. Should make more accurate measurements next time.
