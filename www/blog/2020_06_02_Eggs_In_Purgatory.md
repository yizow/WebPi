# Cooking Experiments - Eggs in Purgatory

One of the hobbies I've picked up during quarantine is cooking.

And so, my decision to find a recipe off the internet, _and then repeat it 4 times in a row_, tweaking it each time till I'm satisfied, and recording my process and results here.

This is actually the second recipe I'm trying; after finishing my [meatloaf experiements](http://yizheliu.com/recipes/meatloaf.md), a friend suggested than I chronicle the whole process as well as the result.


# Iteration 0

My first exposure to this dish was actually an entirely different recipe, [Italian Egg Bake](https://www.cottercrunch.com/italian-egg-bake/). I consider that a failure and I really, really didn't like it.

Although to be fair, the recipe called for fresh oregano/basil, and all I had on hand was dried. As a spice noob, I just followed what the recipe called for... I learned that day they have very different {flavor unit} : volume ratios. Mea culpa.



The previous recipe went so poorly that I was going to just abandon it, until a friend sent [this recipe](https://tworedbowls.com/2018/10/26/gochujang-eggs-in-purgatory/) that seemed very similar, so I figured, eh, let's give it one more try. I'm glad I did because it turned out amazing.

What follows is a lightly edited version of thoughts I had during / after cooking tasting.

Final results [here!](http://yizheliu.com/recipes/eggs_in_purgatory.md) Next time around I'll be sure to take more pictures. For now, here's a random smattering.

# Iteration 1

## Cooking Stream of Consciousness

* Didn't have diced/ canned tomatos as the recipe called for. Instead I have both fresh tomatos and tomato sauce.
* And I just don't have parsley.
* For this first iteration I chose to use fresh tomatos: 5 of em worked out to ~25 ounces

* Recipe calls for:
  > Season with salt and pepper to taste

  ...I have next to no idea what "to taste" means. Welp, guess I'm just tossing in a random amount of salt and pepper and hoping for the best.

* Lesson number 1 after adding in the tomatos: I need to dice them more.
* After a bit of time of the tomatos cooking, it looks a bit too liquidy. Perhaps a 50:50 of tomatos to tomato sauce? I think internet told me that tomato sauce is thicker.
* Oh no. The recipe called to simmer tomatos for 15 minutes. I have forgotten how many minutes its been...
* "cup" of spinach. Naaah just toss in two giant handfuls.
* Recipe calls to serve on toast. I have rice instead.
* Huh. This is probably a breakfast recipe I'm having for dinner, isn't it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Takeaways

* Reminds me quite a bit of traditional chinese tomato+egg+rice dish.
* I want to try playing with fresh tomato: tomato sauce ratio to see if i can get a creamier/ layer on top of rice kind of thing going.
* Not sure how i feel about the purgatory eggs. I find myself just eating them as part of the rest anyways. They are good though. I think it's more about the cooking time, and having it not scrambled. I cooked for a few minutes longer than the 7 minutes the recipe calls for.
* Should not have attempted presentation of layering over rice. Much better to have just left it in pot, and scooped out.
* Salt and pepper also seem to be good. I added in as very first step with onions and garlic. Should make more accurate measurements next time.

# Iteration 2

## Cooking tweaks

* I'm cheating when adding brown sugar, maybe adding up to 3, 3.5 teaspoons?
* 2 fresh tomatos, 1 15 ounce can of tomato sauce.
* Salt/pepper: 1/2 teaspoon each
* Used one red onion, one yellow onion.
* Diced the tomatos a lot more

## Takeaways

* Need to use 1/4 teaspoon pepper only
* Tomato sauce does not exactly make it creamier
* Too much onion to tomato ratio. Either need less onion, or more tomato/tomato sauce
* Tomato sauce does not have same mass as fresh tomatoes
* I added more spinach than last time, like 3.5, 4 handfuls, and it seems fine. everything shrivels.
* Is a little bit too sweet, can stop cheating as much on the brown sugar.

# Iteration 3

## Cooking Tweaks

* 2.5 teaspoon brown sugar
* One larger white onion, about 2 cups worth.
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* Using 2 cans of tomato sauce this time (15 ounce each, total 30 ounce)

## Takeaways

* Extremely liquid-y when poured out of can; after about 7 minutes of cooking starts congealing.
* The texture definitely looks a lot more different. This one appears to just be a slightly thick sauce.
* Definitely feels like "less" stuff. May need to use 3 cans if I want to do pure tomato sauce (pending taste test)

## Taste test

Oh god that is not good. Two cans of tomato sauce is way too sodium heavy, and overwhelms everything flavor wise. It's way too salty for me. One can of tomato sauce for the herbs and flavoring might be nice to use.

# Iteration 4

## Cooking Tweaks

* Used pure fresh tomatos this time
* 2 smaller white onions

Otherwise, recipe is becoming pretty set.

## Takeaways

Definitely want a can of tomato sauce to add thickness and texture
