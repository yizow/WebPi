# Ingredients
* Big flour tortilla
* Potato
* White Onion (diced)
* Baby spinach / misc. leafy greens
* Sausage (diced) (personal preference, but I recommend something with a 'bite' to it)
* Eggs
* Sour cream
* Avocado (diced)
* (Optional) Tomatos, but make sure to strain them, otherwise juice is too messy.

# Recipe

## Prep
* Bake potatos for 1 hour at 375 degrees. After, remove and cube into 1-inch chunks.
* Add oil and onions, cook until lightly brown.
* Add potato to onions, press down lightly, and let crisp up for 5 minutes. Then, flip and repeat for 5 more minutes. Remove and set aside.
* Add sausage (and oil if needed), lightly caramelize.
* Add in eggs and cook together until eggs scrambled.

## Burrito assembly time!
* Add in thin strip of potato and onion. Too much will make it impossible to wrap.
* Add in eggs and sausage scramble.
* Add in avocado.
* Add in thin strip of sour cream.
* Add in leafy greens.
* Roll!
