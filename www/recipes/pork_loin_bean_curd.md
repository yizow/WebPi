# Ingredients
# Stir Fry
1/2 lb. pork loin
1/2 lb. bean curd (dried tofu)
2 green onion
4 cloves garlic
Some sichuan peppercorn

## Meat Marinade
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 2 tsp. garlic paste
* 1 tsp. ground white pepper
* 1 tsp. soy sauce
* 1 tbsp. Shaoxing wine
* 1 tsp. sesame oil (Add separately)
* 2 tsp. cornstarch (Add separately)

## Sauce
* 2 tsp. soy sauce
* 1 tsp. oyster sauce
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 3 tbsp. Shaoxing wine
* 1 tsp. ground white pepper

# Recipe
* Cut the pork loin into thin slivers.
* Mix in all of the marinade except the sesame oil and cornstarch. Mix until the meat has absorbed everything.
* Add in the sesame oil, mix until absorbed.
* Add in the cornstarch, mix until absorbed.
* Set aside to marinate, ~15 minutes. Cover top of bowl with plastic wrap and push down to remove air, to marinate faster.
* Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add in the bean curd, wait until the water returns to a boil, then cook for 3 minutes.
* Remove bean curd and set aside to cool down.
* While waiting, slice the green onions diagonally, and mince the garlic. Keep the green and white parts of the green onion separate.
* When the bean curds have cooled down, cut into thin slivers, similar size to the pork loin.
* Starting from a cold pan, cook oil and peppercorn on a low-medium heat until the peppercorn is aromatic and the oil is boiling. Then, remove peppercorn.
* Add in the bean curd, spread flat, then cook for 2 minutes. After, toss and stir fry until golden.
* Push bean curd to side, add pork loin. You may need to use chopsticks to separate.
* Once pork loin has changed color, stir fry and mix with bean curd.
* Add in sauce and mix in.
* Add in white part of green onion.
* Once sauce is absorbed completely, mix in garlic and rest of the green onion. Stir fry until done, just a few minutes.
* Serve with rice.
