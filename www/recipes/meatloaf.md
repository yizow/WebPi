# Ingredients

## Loaf
* 1/2 lb ground pork
* 1/2 lb ground beef
* 1 1/2 cup bread crumbs
* 1 1/2 cup diced yellow onion
* 1/2 cup (one handful?) shredded carrots
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 large eggs, beaten
* 2 tbsp ketchup
* 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp. pepper

## Topping 
* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 1 tbsp. brown sugar
* 1 tbsp. rice vinegar

# Recipe
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit
2. Mix all loaf ingredients together, thoroughly.
3. Transfer loaf to a baking dish; I prefer wide and flat, lined with aluminum foil.
4. In a separate bowl, mix topping ingredients together, then add on top of loaf. Should only be a thin layer.
5. Bake for 55 minutes.
6. Let stand for 10 minutes after, to firm up.
